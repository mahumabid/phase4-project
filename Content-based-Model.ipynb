    "This type of recommender system uses specific characteristics or features of an item, such as its description, to suggest similar items to the user. It also takes into account the user's preferences and history to generate personalized recommendations. For example, it can recommend movies that are similar to a movie that the user has watched or based on all of the movies that the user has viewed. The system extracts relevant features from the item and uses the user's history to provide suggestions."
